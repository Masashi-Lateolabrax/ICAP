# CMAES CRobot Swarm Simple

In this scheme, we aim to determine the proper hyperparameters for
a small size swarm composed of CRobots to transport food to the nest.

The CRobot swarm consists of nine robots.
They are placed in the nest, and their initial direction is set to
the positive X-axis.

Food is placed along the Y-axis.
