# CRobot Swarm Schedule

In this scheme, the training of the CRobot Swarm is separated into two parts:
static position training and random position training.

Static position training is used to train the CRobot Swarm to move food which
is placed at a fixed position. The CRobot Swarm is trained to move the food to
the center of the arena.

Random position training is used to train the CRobot Swarm to move food which
is placed at a random position. The CRobot Swarm is trained to move the food to
the center of the arena.
