Currently, we can train two robots, so the next challenge is to train nine robots.

The analysis code supports recording training results and animating robot positions, food positions, and relative nest
directions. We will implement plotting of food sensor inputs.

### TODO

- [x] Implement training of nine robots
- [ ] Implement plotting of food sensor inputs
